# Binary Search Tree

This repository contains a binary search tree implementation using Python and OOP principles. All classes are in
separate files (modules).

# Testing

* To create a node, use:
```python
your_name = Node()
```
* To give this node a value, use:
```python
your_name.set_value(some_value)
```
* To create a tree, use:
```python
bst = BinarySearchTree()
```
* To add this node to a tree, use:
```python
bst.insert(your_node)
```
* To delete a node, use:
```python
bst.delete(your_node)
```
* To print the contents of the tree, use:
```python
bst.print_bst()
```
